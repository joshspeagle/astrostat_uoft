  <p>
    Statistics and data are integral parts of many areas of modern astronomy, and so the ART is conducting research in a
    broad range of areas across astrophysics, statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence (AI). Information on
    some of the areas and topics we are currently investigating, along with the <a

        <a href=https://www.space.com/fast-radio-bursts>Fast radio bursts (FRBs)</a> are one of the most mysterious
        astrophysical phenomena in the Universe. An FRB is a short, energetic radio pulse (on the order of milliseconds)
        of unknown progenitor, although leading theories suggest these energetic pulses could be from magnetars of
        extragalactic origin. Moreover, some FRBs are observed to repeat, while others are not. Some members of the ART
        are part of the <a href=https://chime-experiment.ca/en>Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment
          (CHIME)</a> FRB Collaboration, where we are developing new statistical methods to better understand the
        subpopulations of repeating and non-repeating FRBs. (Image credit: Danielle Futselaar/artsource.nl.)

        One of the biggest mysteries in physics and astronomy is <a
          href=https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-matter>dark matter</a>. Almost every galaxy in the universe is
        thought to reside in a dark matter halo, and these halos play an important part in galaxy evolution. In the ART,
        we seek to answer fundamental questions such as: What is the amount and distribution of dark matter in the <a
          href=https://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/astronomy/the-milky-way-galaxy2>Milky Way Galaxy</a>, elliptical
        galaxies, and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_diffuse_galaxy>ultra-diffuse galaxies</a>? How well do
        our formation theories for these systems hold up against exciting new data sets from <a
          href=https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia>Gaia</a>, <a
          href=https://webb.nasa.gov />JWST</a>, <a href=https://www.desi.lbl.gov />DESI</a>, and <a
          href=https://www.lsst.org />LSST</a>? We use and develop a variety of statistical methods (e.g., hierarchical
        Bayesian inference, model comparison, log-Gaussian Cox Processes and inhomogeneous Poisson Processes) to analyze
        data from the Milky Way, other galaxies, and globular clusters around ultra-diffuse galaxies in order to better
        understand the distribution and amount of dark matter in these systems and throughout the Universe at large.

        The formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies is largely a mystery. It is unknown how and how
        quickly galaxies built up their mass in the high-redshift universe, what the first stars looked like and how
        they enriched their galactic environments, and how conditions for star formation differed in the early universe.
        Observing the first galaxies is generally observationally unfeasible, and so in the ART, we are using a variety
        of observational and statistical methods, including Bayesian hierarchical modelling and spatial statistics like
        inhomogeneous Poisson point processes, to probe the early Universe using other objects we can observe with
        instruments like Gaia and JWST. These include nearby <a
          href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster>globular clusters</a>, which are some of the oldest
        stellar structures, and <a

          quiescent galaxies</a>, which are some of the largest, brightest, and oldest galaxies in the Universe. (Image

        The messiness of how galaxies actually form, grow, and evolve can be seen in data as varied as nearby <a

        streams</a> (i.e. tidal debris) in the local Universe through to the most distant observable galaxies with JWST.
        Because each galaxy is only observed once, unpicking the relationships between each variable that drives
        evolution (star formation, gas accretion, mergers, <a
          href=https://webbtelescope.org/contents/articles/what-are-active-galactic-nuclei>supermassive black holes</a>,

        The <a href=https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/local-group-guide-galaxy-neighbourhood>Local
          Group</a> of galaxies, which consists of the Milky Way (MW), Andromeda (M31), and their satellite dwarfs, are
        some of the only galaxies in the entire universe that we are able to study on both the smallest and largest
        scales. This allows us to connect the properties of individual stars (such as their positions, motion, and
        chemistry) to the properties of galaxies as a whole. Using various chemodynamical and other statistical
        modelling techniques, we are able to reconstruct a galaxy’s formation and evolution history as well as its
        present-day structure. This allows us to then place the MW and the Local Group in their cosmological contexts
        through comparisons with other galaxies along with expectations from theory and simulations. (Image credit:

        While we like to think of our Sun as a "typical" star that we understand well, many observations both within and
        outside our Solar System suggest otherwise. Stars turn out to have complex interior structures, chemical mixing,
        magnetic activity, and evolutionary pathways...and that's before considering that most stars actually have
        stellar companions which they will interact during the lifetimes. The recent advent of <a
          href=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-are-gw>gravitational wave</a> detectors such as <a
          href=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/about>LIGO</a> has also revealed a complicated picture of the deaths of
        stars (as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, etc.) This had led to a renaissance for the study of stellar
        evolution. The ART tries to tackle this problem from multiple angles by leveraging statistical and machine
        learning methods across large datasets to identify and characterize a variety of stellar populations including
        magnetically-active stars, ancient metal-poor stars, rare binary stellar systems, and variable stars. (Image

        Flexible, scalable inference with large datasets refers to the ability to perform statistical analysis and draw
        conclusions from large data in an adaptive and efficient manner. Many of the methods best-suited for this (such
        as hierarchical inference), however, struggle to handle the increase in volume of data. By contrast, many
        machine learning methods that scale to these large datasets with ease are unable to provide robust conclusions
        with realistic uncertainties. Reconciling these two methods of analysis remains a central challenges for
        obtaining useful insights in the current and upcoming era of overwhelmingly large astronomical surveys. People
        in the ART are working on new sampling techniques, data-driven approaches, and data integration strategies to
        help overcome these issues. (Image credit: Simeon Carstens.)

        AI models are a powerful tool for interpreting data, especially images. We rely on them to classify millions of
        galaxies, find the weirdest objects in the sky, identify strong gravitational lenses, and much more. But these
        models generally only provide measurements; they don't explain why a particular galaxy has a strong lens or that
        galaxy is unusual. Many also don't make decisions in a way that builds on existing intuition or physical
        knowledge. To tackle these issues, members of the ART are building new physics-informed, probabilistic, and
        robust AI models as well as tools to investigate why these AI models make the decisions that they do. (Image
