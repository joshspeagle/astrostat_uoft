    Welcome to the ART!
  </h1>

  <p>
    From the smallest stars to the largest galaxies, the <b>Astrostatistics Research Team (ART)</b> is an
    interdisciplinary research group using cutting-edge statistics and artificial intelligence to unravel the mysteries
    of the Universe! Please follow the links for more information about the <a
      href="https://astrostatuoft.com/research.html"><strong>exciting work</strong></a> that we do and the <a

  <h2>
    Statstro Workshop
  </h2>

  <p>
    Since 2021, the ART has also organized <strong>"Statstro"</strong> (originally "Stellar Stats" from 2021-2023), an
    annual one-day
    workshop that aims to bring together researchers from astrophysics, statistics, computer science, and other related
    fields to celebrate interdisciplinary research, discuss ongoing challenges, and forge new connections. While
    originally only open to University of Toronto affiliates, in recent years participation has been broadened to
    include researchers from other institutions. More information can be found on the <a
      href="https://statstro.com/index.html"><strong>official Statstro website</strong></a>.
