  <p>
    From the smallest stars to the largest galaxies, the <b>Astrostatistics Research Team (ART)</b> is an interdisciplinary research group using cutting-edge statistics and artificial intelligence to unravel the mysteries of the Universe! Please follow the links for more information about the <a href="https://astrostatuoft.com/research.html">exciting work</a> that we do and the <a href="https://astrostatuoft.com/people.html">wonderful people</a> who make it all happen.

    Since 2021, we have also organized "Statstro" (originally "Stellar Stats" from 2021-2023), an annual one-day workshop that aims to bring together researchers from astrophysics, statistics, computer science, and other related fields to celebrate interdisciplinary research, discuss ongoing challenges, and forge new connections. While originally only open to University of Toronto affiliates, in recent years participation has been broadened to include researchers from other institutions. More information can be found on the <a href="https://statstro.com/index.html">official Statstro website</a>.
