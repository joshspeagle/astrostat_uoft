Sam is a 4th year PhD candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, supervised by Gwen Eadie and Josh Speagle. Her research focuses on using globular cluster (GC) populations as a probe of galaxy formation and evolution, especially for low-mass galaxies. She is specifically interested in what deviations from the well-characterized scaling relationship between galaxy mass and GC populations can tell us about how clusters form and the varying evolutionary pathways of low-mass galaxies. She employs Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques to answer these questions, and strives to introduce a wider range of statistical models in the astronomy literature.

Alex is a second year graduate student in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Josh Speagle and <a href=https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~drout/>Maria Drout</a>. His research focuses on a combination of machine learning and stellar evolution. Specifically, he develops data-driven models to discover 'needles in a haystack': new, rare stellar populations in large-scale surveys. Subsequently, he attempts to understand the nature of these rare populations through a combination of follow-up observations and stellar evolution models. On the machine learning side, he has developed a purely data-driven model for low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra based on variational-autoencoders. On the stellar evolution side, he is focused on binary-stripped helium stars and carbon-enhanced metal poor stars.

          <p>
Aarya completed her PhD in 2023 in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics under the joint supervision of Gwen Eadie and <a href=https://astro.utoronto.ca/~bovy/>Jo Bovy</a>. She is now a <a href=https://rubinobservatory.org/>Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</a> Discovery Alliance Catalyst Postdoctoral Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. She previously obtained her BEng in Computer Engineering from S. P. Pune University in India. Her current research lies at the intersection of astrophysics and statistics by developing novel data-driven tools that guide mathematical models of the Milky Way Galaxy.
