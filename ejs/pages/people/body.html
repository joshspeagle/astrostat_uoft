          <p>
Sam is a 4th year PhD candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, supervised by Gwen Eadie and Josh Speagle. Her research focuses on using globular cluster (GC) populations as a probe of galaxy formation and evolution, especially for low-mass galaxies. She is specifically interested in what deviations from the well-characterized scaling relationship between galaxy mass and GC populations can tell us about how clusters form and the varying evolutionary pathways of low-mass galaxies. She employs Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques to answer these questions, and strives to introduce a wider range of statistical models in the astronomy literature.

          <p>
Alex is a second year graduate student in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Josh Speagle and <a href=https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~drout/>Maria Drout</a>. His research focuses on a combination of machine learning and stellar evolution. Specifically, he develops data-driven models to discover 'needles in a haystack': new, rare stellar populations in large-scale surveys. Subsequently, he attempts to understand the nature of these rare populations through a combination of follow-up observations and stellar evolution models. On the machine learning side, he has developed a purely data-driven model for low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra based on variational-autoencoders. On the stellar evolution side, he is focused on binary-stripped helium stars and carbon-enhanced metal poor stars.

Phil is a 2nd year PhD student in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Drs. Eadie and Speagle and Dr. <a href=https://r-cloutier.github.io/>Ryan Cloutier</a> (McMaster). His research focuses on leveraging machine learning and statistical methods to develop stellar dating methods using rotation and magnetic activity data, with a focus on low-mass stars known as M dwarfs. His long-term goal is to build a catalogue of M dwarf ages and use these constraints to inform exoplanet evolutionary analyses. He previously completed his BSc at University of Waterloo in Earth Sciences with a Geophysics specialization, then worked in engineering consulting, software development, data engineering, and product management roles for several years before beginning his PhD in Fall 2022.
