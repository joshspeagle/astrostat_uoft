Her research focuses on using globular cluster (GC) populations as a probe of galaxy formation and evolution, especially for low-mass galaxies. She is specifically interested in what deviations from the well-characterized scaling relationship between galaxy mass and GC populations can tell us about how clusters form and the varying evolutionary pathways of low-mass galaxies. She employs Bayesian hierarchical modeling techniques to answer these questions, and strives to introduce a wider range of statistical models in the astronomy literature.

His research focuses on a combination of machine learning and stellar evolution. Specifically, he develops data-driven models to discover 'needles in a haystack': new, rare stellar populations in large-scale surveys. Subsequently, he attempts to understand the nature of these rare populations through a combination of follow-up observations and stellar evolution models. On the machine learning side, he has developed a purely data-driven model for low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra based on variational-autoencoders. On the stellar evolution side, he is focused on binary-stripped helium stars and carbon-enhanced metal poor stars.

          <p><a href=https://andrew-saydjari.github.io/>Personal Website</a></p>
          <p> 
Andrew is a <a href=https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2024-nhfp-fellows>NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow</a> in the <a href=https://web.astro.princeton.edu/>Princeton Department of Astrophysical Sciences</a>. His research focuses on combining astrophysics, statistics, and high-performance coding to study the chemical, spatial, and kinematic variations in the dust that permeates the Milky Way. He believes knowledge comes from data, and data comes from instruments - a view that shapes his approach to science. He is also passionate about scientific communication, open source software/data availability, and the replication crisis.

          <p>
Steffani is a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics working with <a href=https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~drout/>Maria Drout</a> and <a href=https://www.yorku.ca/professor/jeremywebb/>Jeremy Webb</a> (York University). She is interested in studying the evolution of massive stars in groups, including the evolution of post-common envelope binaries and the outcomes of dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments (such as globular clusters and open clusters). With Josh Speagle, she also develops statistical and machine learning-driven approaches to try and search for such systems.
