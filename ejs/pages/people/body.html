          <p>Tanveer Karim is an Arts & Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto and a member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration and the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). His current research interest is developing frameworks to constrain cosmological models by cross-correlating multiple surveys and improving interpretability of the constraints to address various cosmological tensions. Previously, he has also extensively worked on target selection of emission-line galaxies for DESI, mitigation of observational systematics, as well as projects pertaining to the Milky Way and analysis of stellar rotation periods. Outside of research, Tanveer loves to learn languages, play board games and read books. <a href= https://tanveerkarim.com/>Personal Website</a></p>

On the dynamics side, he is currently using hierarchical Bayesian models to combine archival Hubble Space Telescope images with Gaia data to measure significantly improved astrometry, particularly for faint stars. For stellar parameters and chemistry, Kevin is working with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) to help improve the APOGEE spectral reduction and abundance pipelines for the Milky Way Mapper program.</p>

            problems related to fast radio bursts, high-energy astrophysics, and circumgalactic media. 
            Prior to entering graduate school, she received an honors mathematics and physics degree from
            McGill University, and held a variety of summer research positions including at NASA JPL and the University of Kyoto.

          <p>Anika is a second-year graduate student at the University of Toronto who works with Gwen Eadie on improving statistical methods of estimating masses of astronomical systems. They are interested in uncertainty analysis and have done work with outlier detection and dimensionality reduction of multiwavelength image data. Anika’s long-term goal is to develop a consistent and accurate way to combine data from multiple types of populations to estimate properties of the Galaxy.</p>

          <span class="h3">Alex Laroche</span>
          <p>Alex is a second year graduate student in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Josh Speagle and Maria Drout. His research focuses on a combination of machine learning and stellar evolution. Specifically, he develops data-driven models to discover 'needles in a haystack': new, rare stellar populations in large-scale surveys. Subsequently, he attempts to understand the nature of these rare populations through a combination of follow-up observations and stellar evolution models. On the machine learning side, he has developed a purely data-driven model for low-resolution Gaia BP/RP spectra based on variational-autoencoders. On the stellar evolution side, he is focused on binary-stripped helium stars and carbon-enhanced metal poor stars. <a href=https://alexlaroche7.github.io/>Personal Website</a></p>

          <span class="h3">Phil Van-Lane</span>
          <p> Phil is a 2nd year PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics co-supervised by Drs. Eadie and Speagle, 
and Dr. Ryan Cloutier from McMaster University. His research focuses on leveraging machine learning and statistical
 methods to develop stellar dating methods using rotation and magnetic activity data, with a focus on M dwarfs.
 His long-term goal is to build a catalogue of M dwarf ages, and use these constraints to inform exoplanet evolutionary analyses. 
He previously completed his BSc at University of Waterloo in Earth Sciences with a Geophysics specialization,
 then worked in engineering consulting, software development, data engineering, and product management roles for several years before beginning his PhD in Fall 2022.

            is co-advised by Professors Gwendolyn Eadie and Joshua Speagle. Her research broadly
            focuses on citizen science projects to determine how to improve classification accuracy
            through volunteer user input, and is interested in using these methods to improve image 
            classification accuracy within Galaxy Zoo. Prior to UofT, she completed her MS in Statistics 
            from San Diego State University and BS in Mathematics from UC San Diego.
