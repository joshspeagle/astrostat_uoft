            Marta Reina-Campos is a CITA Canada Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href=https://www.cita.utoronto.ca>Canadian
              Institute for Theoretical
              Astrophysics (CITA)</a> and <a href=https://www.mcmaster.ca>McMaster University</a>. She is interested in learning how stellar clusters form
            and
            evolve as galaxies grow and merge, including by developing new physical models of star formation and
            feedback and testing them using large, complex numerical simulations of galaxy formation. She also tries to
            use old, massive stellar cluster populations as near-field cosmological tracers, including most recently
            using data from the <a href=https://www.jwst.nasa.gov>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</a>.

            Ioana is a <a href=https://www.cita.utoronto.ca>CITA</a> Postdoctoral Fellow and an <a
              href=https://schmidtfellows.utoronto.ca>Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science</a> Fellow. She is originally
            from Romania and came to the United States to pursue
            a physics degree at <a href=https://www.mit.edu>MIT</a> (B.A. '14). After that, she completed her M.A. ('16) and Ph.D. ('21) in astronomy
            and astrophysics at <a href=https://www.harvard.edu>Harvard University</a> and was a postdoc at <a href=https://www.ucla.edu>UCLA</a> from 2022-2023. Her research focuses on
            trying to constrain the properties of dust and dark matter through a variety of observational probes,
            including strong galaxy lensing and large photometric surveys. Ioana is also passionate about outreach and
            mentorship and has been heavily involved with the <a href=https://usaaao.org>United States Astronomy and
              Astrophysics Organisation/Olympiad</a> for many years.

            high-performance
            coding to study the chemical, spatial, and kinematic variations in the dust that permeates the Milky Way. He
            believes knowledge comes from data, and data comes from instruments - a view that shapes his approach to
            science. He is also passionate about scientific communication, open source software/data availability, and
            the replication crisis.

            simulations of hot plasma in accretion disk coronae around active galactic nuclei. Specifically, she is
            working on incorporating more physics into the simulation code to compare against theory and observations.
            Along with <a href=https://joshspeagle.com>Josh Speagle</a>, she is also interested in studying galaxy
            evolution in cosmological simulations,
